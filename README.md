[![repo standards badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?color=blue&style=for-the-badge&logo=github&label=MoJ%20Compliant&query=%24.result&url=https%3A%2F%2Foperations-engineering-reports.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fcompliant_public_repositories%2Fmodernisation-platform-terraform-ssm-patching)](https://operations-engineering-reports.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/public-github-repositories.html#modernisation-platform-terraform-ssm-patching "Link to report")

## Usage

To use this module, you must have instances with the SSM agent installed (Comes as default with many AMIS), as well as have a tag of "Patching: Yes"

We're looking to add more functionality with tagging, so these requirements may change in further releases.

```hcl

module "ssm-auto-patching" {
  source = "github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-terraform-ssm-patching.git?ref="
  count  = local.environment == "development" ? 1 : 0
  providers = {
    aws.bucket-replication = aws
  }

  account_number             = local.environment_management.account_ids[terraform.workspace]
  application_name           = local.application_name
  tags = merge(
    local.tags,
    {
      Name = "ssm-patching"
    },
  )
}

## Issues

- Patching offered in this module works, with cross account patching also working, however I have included cloudformation templates in the repo as with cross account patching, until all of it has been tested some IAM permissions errors are raised.
- Currently in the single account patching you can select the patch_classification, going forward I will add the ability to select single patches, similarly to cross-account patching.
- Currently in the single account patching via patch manager you have to select the operating system, if multiple operating systems are used, then multiple patch manager jobs need to be run. In the scheduled job via an automation script, this is not required, and it will run against all offered operating systems automatically. I would like to offer this via patch manager in the future.
